## Project setup

**Environment setup**

Use the Node version listed in the [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) file. If you have [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, you can detect and use the correct version by running `nvm use` inside the project directory.

**Editor setup**

If you are using Visual Studio Code, the [.vscode](./vscode) folder lists required extensions and settings.
